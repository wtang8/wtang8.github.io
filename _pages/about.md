subtitle: from silicon to carbon and from computation to life, finding order in the unseen, to seek patterns where others see noise and make sense of what connects us.

I am currently open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out via email at <a href="mailto:wstangp@gmail.com">wstangp@gmail.com</a>.

I am a computational biophysicist and software developer trained as a physicist. My research connects the world of silicon: algorithms, computation, and information, to the world of carbon: the molecular and cellular machinery of life.

I build from first principles, combining my physics background with extensive experience in software development, numerical modelling, and statistical inference. My work focuses on developing Bayesian methods, numerical algorithms, and high-performance software for analysing complex biological data. I have contributed to open-source frameworks for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), developing models that link molecular images to physical structure and dynamics.

Across all my work, I aim to uncover the hidden order in biological systems through rigorous, quantitative methods. I am particularly motivated by interdisciplinary research, where computation, mathematics, and biology converge to illuminate the organising principles of living matter.

The connection between silicon and carbon continues to shape my perspective: from building machines that process information to studying the molecular machines that make life possible.
