[Under Construction]

I am a computational biophysicist and software developer trained as a physicist. My research connects the world of silicon: algorithms, computation, and information, to the world of carbon: the molecular and cellular machinery of life.

I build from first principles, combining my physics background with extensive experience in software development, numerical modelling, and statistical inference. My work focuses on developing Bayesian methods, numerical algorithms, and high-performance software for analysing complex biological data. I have contributed to open-source frameworks for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), developing models that link molecular images to physical structure and dynamics.

Across all my work, I aim to uncover the hidden order in biological systems through rigorous, quantitative methods. I am particularly motivated by interdisciplinary research, where computation, mathematics, and biology converge to illuminate the organising principles of living matter.

The connection between silicon and carbon continues to shape my perspective: from building machines that process information to studying the molecular machines that make life possible.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
