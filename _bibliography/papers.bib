	abstract = {Extracting conformational heterogeneity from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images is particularly challenging for flexible biomolecules, where traditional 3D classification approaches often fail. Over the past few decades, advancements in experimental and computational techniques have been made to tackle this challenge, especially Bayesian-based approaches that provide physically interpretable insights into cryo-EM heterogeneity. To reduce the computational cost for Bayesian approaches, we introduce CryoLike, a computationally efficient algorithm for evaluating image-to-structure (or image-to-volume) likelihoods across large image datasets, which is built on Fourier-Bessel representations of the images and packaged in a user-friendly Python workflow.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a technique that takes projection images of biomolecules frozen at cryogenic temperatures. A major advantage of this technique is its ability to image single biomolecules in heterogeneous conformations. While this poses a challenge for data analysis, recent algorithmic advances have enabled the recovery of heterogeneous conformations from the noisy imaging data. Here, we review methods for the reconstruction and heterogeneity analysis of cryo-EM images, ranging from linear-transformation-based methods to nonlinear deep generative models. We overview the dimensionality-reduction techniques used in heterogeneous 3D reconstruction methods and specify what information each method can infer from the data. Then, we review the methods that use cryo-EM images to estimate probability distributions over conformations in reduced subspaces or predefined by atomistic simulations. We conclude with the ongoing challenges for the cryo-EM community.}

    abstract = {Identifying structural differences among proteins can be a non-trivial task. When contrasting ensembles of protein structures obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, biologically-relevant features can be easily overshadowed by spurious fluctuations. Here, we present SINATRA Pro, a computational pipeline designed to robustly identify topological differences between two sets of protein structures. Algorithmically, SINATRA Pro works by first taking in the 3D atomic coordinates for each protein snapshot and summarizing them according to their underlying topology. Statistically significant topological features are then projected back onto a user-selected representative protein structure, thus facilitating the visual identification of biophysical signatures of different protein ensembles. We assess the ability of SINATRA Pro to detect minute conformational changes in five independent protein systems of varying complexities. In all test cases, SINATRA Pro identifies known structural features that have been validated by previous experimental and computational studies, as well as novel features that are also likely to be biologically-relevant according to the literature. These results highlight SINATRA Pro as a promising method for facilitating the non-trivial task of pattern recognition in trajectories resulting from molecular dynamics simulations, with substantially increased resolution.},

  abstract = {The RNA-binding protein FUS (Fused in Sarcoma) mediates phase separation in biomolecular condensates and functions in transcription by clustering with RNA polymerase II. Specific contact residues and interaction modes formed by FUS and the C-terminal heptad repeats of RNA polymerase II (CTD) have been suggested but not probed directly. Here we show how RGG domains contribute to phase separation with the FUS N-terminal low-complexity domain (SYGQ LC) and RNA polymerase II CTD. Using NMR spectroscopy and molecular simulations, we demonstrate that many residue types, not solely arginine-tyrosine pairs, form condensed-phase contacts via several interaction modes including, but not only sp2-π and cation-π interactions. In phases also containing RNA polymerase II CTD, many residue types form contacts, including both cation-π and hydrogen-bonding interactions formed by the conserved human CTD lysines. Hence, our data suggest a surprisingly broad array of residue types and modes explain co-phase separation of FUS and RNA polymerase II.},
